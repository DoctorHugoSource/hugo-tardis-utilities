figure out why the fuck the tardis suddenly doesnt die when falling out of the vortex

improve spark effect for sliding/grinding

improve the math for window tint lerp 

figure out why the shit i get a split second stutter every time i walk out of the tardis
	- it's not the stat saving function
	- it's not the new exit collision improvements
idk what it could be

		edit figured it out, its caused by torrent's hartnell tardis because it makes use of soundscape_flush to control soundscapes while in the interior
		sounscape flush introduces a stutter whenever called, and it only happens in singleplayer or in multiplayer with sv_cheats 1



fix the entire 'lockedang' shenanigans regarding the vortex model

figure out why the vortex appears in full opacity in 3rdperson during the pre-demat phase (see: default tardis demat)

add some funny spin to the new faked vortex crashing

allow cloister sound to play through the door to the outside of the exterior (like the idle sound

add wayyy more and *more responsive* crash and impact effects
	- more shaking, make the interior feel like it's actually moving through the world in the box
	- move the player around during crashing, corresponding to the direction of impact, maybe even throw them through the air depending on how bad it is
	- collision sounds for both exterior and interior
	- a randomn chance for a part to emit sparks after interacting with it on low health, chance increasing with decreasing health
	- since the exterior entity has no physics sounds, use the physicscollide hook to add tardis-flavored collision sounds with the environment
 		-- sound intensity based on collision force/speed


add low-power-low-health lighting options for cases where you're at low health and in low power mode (currently just uses full power off lighting)

if possible, for the love of god figure out some of the rendering bugs
	- exterior blocking all kinds of shit while fading out despite being transparent, basically only props can be seen through it properly
	- prop lighting override fucking up like, EVERYTHING
	- projected textures NOT UPDATING outside of a player's fov
		-- this single handedly kills the kickass awesome flashlight-goes-through-tardis-portal feature sitting in sh_ProjectedFlashlight.lua


eventually figure out why render.GetLightColor doesn't return the true accurate lighting conditions for a given spot of the map
	- this messes up the new door lighting under some conditions


when i figure out how, lock the 3rdperson camera to the tardis when mat'ing so that the tardis doesn't change angle from the camera's view

rafactor a bunch of functions to make code better

add the remaining phase sequences for low health

potentially find better sounds for some events (maybe tardis death, demat with handbrake on)

make broken sounds for mathop during low health mode

add back exterior teleport sounds since i totally neglected those after fixing the interior sounds

finish the rest of the vortexes i keep putting off
also fix the time swap system to accompany them
also also make compressed versions for all the vortexes for the average user (aka not fanatic like me)

make a new check during the finding-interior-stage when spawning the tardis
	- check if a map has a skybox, and if yes, check the area of the skybox for a potential place to spawn the interior
	- benefits: very easy way to find a good spot as most maps have some free space in the skybox
		-- particularly with jazztronauts in mind, where you're likely to travel on your own and thus only one interior spawns anyway
	- downsides: probably only fits one interior at a time, and perhaps the interior can be seen in the skybox sometimes


important: add support for a bunch of extensions so people can play around with all of this stuff

also make alot more systems customizable instead of hardcoded once i can learn how
- map selection for map travel
- interior selection for the tardis key


jazztronauts specific:
add an equipment dispenser carrying all jazztronauts weapons, in case a map strips you of your weapons
add a health and armor dispenser that can be used every once in a while, to give the tardis a bit of a mobile base/home feel that the player can retreat into during travels
